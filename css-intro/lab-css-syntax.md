  ```
* Select `style.css` in the `Files` pane to edit
* Add a style to format `h1` element with your desired colour and a font-size or font-family, e.g.:
* ```
  h1 {
      color: blue; 
      font-size: 40px;
      font-family: 'Times New Roman';
  }
  ```
* Explorer what other style elements you can make work: [https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/), not everything will work as expected
* `run` the changes every time you make a modification to css/html files
* Select index.html in the `Files` pane to edit

* ```
  <h2 id=subTitle>The Cradle of Humankind</h2>
  ```
* Select `style.css` in the `Files` pane to edit
* Use the [CSS id Selector ](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_selectors.asp)syntax to create a style for the text: `The Cradle of Humankind`
* Experiment with different options to achieve the desired look and feel
