## COH

* Start with a blank map
* Start, number of troops
* Write a code to split countries between player and system, number of troops per country?
* Colour countries
* On mouseover show overlay with who owns the country and how many troops are there
* Player attack from here with a number of troops to commit and the enemy country \(drop-down\), confirm
* Player move troops?
* Max number of troops: N-1, min number of troops: 1
* How to detect a border country? List neighbours?
* Battle logic: one vs. one random number generator until troops are exhausted
* Spinner/animation while the outcome of a battle is computed
* Computer: attack from 50% of countries, allocating 50% of troops from each
* End-of-game: player & system has no more troops to commit to a battle or one side owns all the countries

* [https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/wds-sdw/cpr2016-eng.cfm](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/wds-sdw/cpr2016-eng.cfm)
* Start with a map broken down to provinces and maybe more
* On mouseover show an overlay
* On overlay select type of data from a drop-down list
* Button to execute a query
* Display results in a table on the overlay
* Close button to remove an overlay
* Selecting another region should close an open overlay if open
