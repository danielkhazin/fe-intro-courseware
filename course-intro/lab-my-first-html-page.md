# Lab: My First Html Page

* We will be using an online editor
* Nothing is required to be running on your laptop
* Access to your email will be required to create an account
* Open Google Chrome browser to [https://repl.it](https://repl.it/), why Google Chrome? So we all have the same options and icons to streamline the labs. Otherwise, any modern web browser will work just fine.
* Select `Sign up` , you can use Google account, Github account, or sign-up with an email address and a password
* Should you have already an account on repl.it - you are welcome to use it
* If you have selected to create an account with an email address and password, make sure to remember the two
* After you have logged into the newly created repl.it account
* Select `+new repl` and keep it public
* For the language type: `html` and select: `HTML, CSS JS` for the name of the new repl type: `lab-my-first-html-page`
* Select `create repl` and you should get your online environment ready
* On the left hand, you will see the list of files: `index.html`, `script.js` and `style.css`
* In the middle, you will see markup for the index.html
* On the right-hand, you will see a preview of your Html page with a pointing up-and-right arrow to open the preview in a new browser tab
* On top of the screen, there is a `run` button to apply our changes
* If you would like to open a new browser tab to preview your page, refresh the tab to see the changes
* That's all that we need to know about repl.it to start using it as our online integrated development environment
* Select `index.html` in the files on the left
* Select all the markup in the middle pane and delete - we will start from scratch
* Type or copy new html mark-up:

```
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
   <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
   <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

* Right click on the markup and select `Format Document` to beautify it
* Select `run` on the top and the preview pane on the right should refresh to reflect the changes
* You can also select the `open in a new tab` icon
* Let's enhance the Html markup
* Change heading from `This is a Heading` to `Welcome to Cradle of Humanity!`this is going to be the name of our game we will build
* We will discuss the rules as we go or we can, even, come up with new rules
* Next, modify `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>` to `<p>Created by: {your name}.</p>`
* Curly braces or parenthesis `{}` are frequently used to indicate that this text will be replaced
* In our case, you should replace `{your name}` with your actual name or a nickname of your choice
* How do you make changes to appear on the preview panel?
* In Html, we have tag e.g. `<p>` and we have attributes that change the appearance, e.g.: `<p align="right"></p>` will position the content inside the tag on the right-side instead of the default on the left-side
* Let's change the alignment of author name: replace `<p>Created by: {your name}</p>` with `<p align="right">Created by: {your name}</p>` and `run` to see the changes
* What has changed?
* Why has it changed?
