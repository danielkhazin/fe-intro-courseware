# Attributes

* In addition to Html tags, we have covered previously, there are attributes
* An attribute either modifies the appearance of an element type as defined by Html tag
* Example:`<table border="1px">` where `border` is an attribute with the value `1pxl`
* Border attribute will add a border around the table and between every table cell
* Attribute names do not tolerate spaces, you will find some attributes look like two words together, e.g.: [readonly](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_readonly.asp)
* Element names also do not tolerate spaces
* Attribute values are enclosed in double or single quotes
* [Attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_attributes.asp), similarly to elements, are well known and are getting added and removed over time
