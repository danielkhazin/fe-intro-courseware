# Html First Steps

* Html is a language understood by all web browsers to present information on a webpage to the user
* Author of the webpage formats the page using Html tags
* `<html>` tag represents a complete webpage also called 'Html Document'
* * The author also adds content e.g. `This is a paragraph.` between the Html tags:

```
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
   <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
   <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

* You, or so-called, end-user sees, in a web browser, formatted content only:

![](/assets/html.png)

* Where do you see `html, head, body, h1, or p`in the web browser?
* Why are the two lines of text in the web browser different in size?
* Where do you see `<title>Page Title</title>` in the web browser?
