# Html First Steps

* Hypertext Markup Language, a system for tagging text files to achieve font, colour, and graphic
* Creator of the webpage formats page with tags, e.g. `<html>` and content e.g. `This is a paragraph.` :

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
   <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
   <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

* End-user sees in a web browser formatted content only:

![](/assets/html.png)

* Where do you see `html, head, body, h1, or p`in the web browser?
* Why are the two lines in the web browser different?
* Where do you see `<title>Page Title</title>` in the web browser?
* Where do you see `<!DOCTYPE html>` in the web browser?
