# Lab: Attributes

* Open Google Chrome browser to [https://repl.it](https://repl.it/)
* Select `index.html` in the Files pane
* Find the table element and add an attribute [border](https://www.w3resource.com/html/attributes/html-border-attribute.php) to it with any width
* Change the value for the border attribute to see how it changes the appearance of the table
* Locate the phrase `The Cradle of Humankind` in the Html
* Reformat the text to turn it into an [anchor](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp) or a link to this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_Humankind)
* `run` the changes and validate that when you click on the text it takes you to the Wikipedia article
* Notice that the article replaces the current page, let's say we wanted to open the link in another tab or browser window
* There is an attribute for it: [target](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_target.asp)
* Update your Html and validate that the Wikipedia article opens in a new tab or browser window
