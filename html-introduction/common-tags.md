# Common Tags

* Tags in Html define elements, elements are rendered by a web browser for display
* `<head>`Contains other tags/elements describing the document`</head>`
* `<body>`The content of your Html page`</body>`
* `<title>`Tab or Browser Window name`</title>`
* `<h1>`Heading 1or a more prominent text`</h1>`, there are h1 to h6 elements in Html
* `<p>`Paragraph`</p>` is used to define paragraph content in Html
* `<b>`This will render as **bold** text`</b>`
* `<i>`This will render as _italic_ text`</i>`
* `<b><i>`This will render as _**bold italic**_`</i></b>` when elements are often nested
* `<li>`A list item, similar to a bullet point`</li>`
* &lt;!-- This will be a comment for Html author, not rendered by a web browser --&gt;
* `<hr/>` will render a horizontal line, notice how the tag uses a shorter syntax instead of `<hr></hr>` it is just`<hr/>`
* A table with one header row, one content row, and two columns:

```text
<table>
  <thead> 
    <tr>
      <th>First Name</th> 
      <th>Last Name</th> 
    </tr> 
  </thead> 
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>John</td>
      <td>Smith</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

* There are quite a bit more [Html tags](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/default.ASP), some are being added and some removed as Html evolves
* Web browsers are not the same and you may see some surprises with different browsers, e.g. Chrome vs. Firefox
