# Variables

Most of the time a program needs to work with infromation whether storing, accessing, or modifying it

With the most simple statement such as `1 + 1` the result of the addition needs to be stored somewhere

To create a variable in modern JavaScript we use a `let` keyword e.g.: `let message = 'Hello World'; `

Previous version of JavaScript used `var` keyword: `var message = 'Hello World';` 

When searching online for examples you will find both and both work in the most recent version of JavaScript
