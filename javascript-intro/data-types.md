# Data Types

![](/assets/data-types.png)

* Data types define the type of data a variable can hold
* Different programming languages support different data types
* JavaScript does not have too many built-in or primary data types
* The **string** data type represents a sequence of characters or a text, e.g.: `'Hello World!'` or `"Hello World!"`
* The **number** is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without fractions: `1`, `-10,` `2.5`, or `.5`
* The **boolean** data type can hold only two values: `true` or `false`
