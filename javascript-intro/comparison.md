# Comparison Operators

* The comparison operators are used to compare two values
* E.g. is `a` equal to `b` will be expressed as `a == b`
* The result of comparison evaluates to a boolean: `true` or `false`
* When `a` is equal to `b` the result of evaluation will be `true` otherwise `false`

| Operator | Description | Example |
| - | - | - |
| == | Equal value | True when value is the same: `1 == 1` |
| == | Equal data type and value | True when data type and value are the same: `1 === 1` |
| != | Not equal value | True when values are different: `1 != 2` |
| == | Not equal data type and value | True when values or data types are different: `1 !== 2` |
| > | Greater than | True when value is greater: `1 > 0` |
| < | Less than | True when value is less: `1 < 2` |
| >= | Greater than or equal | True when value is greater or equal: `1 >= 1` and `1 >= 0` |
| <= | Less than or equal | True when value is less than or equal: `0 <= 0` and `0 <= 1`|
