# Lab: Operators and Conditions

* Navigate to [https://repl.it](https://repl.it) and login if required
* Create a new repl and select JavaScript template, name it `lab-js-ops-conditions`
* In the middle pane, you will be writing JavaScript code
* The `run` button on the top will execute your JavaScript
* In the right pane, you will see the result of code execution
* Declare two variables with any valid names, there are [rules](https://www.dummies.com/web-design-development/javascript/naming-javascript-variables/) how to name variables
* Assign two numeric values to the two variables, e.g.:
```
const value1 = 1; //not the same as const value1 = '1';
const value2 = 2;
```
* Declare a new variable and assign the result of any of the following operators to it:
  * Addition
  * Subtraction
  * Multiplication
  * Division
* Print the result of operation using `console.log()` statement
* After you have validated the outcome, remove all your statements to start anew
* Declare two variables and assign a string value to each e.g.
```
const firstName = 'John'; 
const lastName = 'Smith';
```
* Declare a new variable and use string [concatenation assignment](https://docs.onux.com/en-US/Developers/JavaScript-PP/Language/Reference/Expressions/assignment-operators/concatenation) to assign value to it
* Print the result of operation using `console.log()` statement
* Modify your code to multiple or to divide two strings or string variables e.g.: `console.log('John' * 'Smith');`
* After you have validated the outcome, remove all your statements to start anew
* Declare new variable and assign a numeric value to it
* Declare a third variable and assign a result of increment by 1 using the [pre-increment operator](https://www.tutorialgateway.org/increment-and-decrement-operators-in-javascript/)
* Write an `if` statement to check whether the result of increment is greater than or equal to a value of 10
* Inside the parenthesis write a statement to print out the value using `console.log()` statement
* How do you change the value to get the statement to print out or to be silent?
