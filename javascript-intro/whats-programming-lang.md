# What is a Programming Language

* Similarly to a human written language: a vocabulary and a set of rules to write instructions to a computer
* Most programming languages are textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation
* Learning a programming language is memorizing the vocabulary and practicing the rules 
* Programmer proficiency is the ability of a human to communicate her/his intentions to a computer
* A few, if any, humans know all the words and grammar rules in a given human language
* A few programmers know all aspects of a programming language
* Not too many programmers use just one programming language through their lifetime
* Online references and self-study is a daily necessity for Information Technology hobbyists and professionals
* No one comes out of a programming course as an expert, we will learn enough to get started with JavaScript
