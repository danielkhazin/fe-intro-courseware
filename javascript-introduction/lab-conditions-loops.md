# Lab: Conditions & Loops

1. Navigate to [https://repl.it](https://repl.it) and login if required
2. Create a new repl and select JavaScript template, name it `lab-js-conditions-loops`
3. In the middle pane, you will be writing JavaScript code
4. The `run` button on the top will execute your JavaScript
5. In the right pane, you will see the result of code execution
6. This lab will not provide detailed instructions instead there are links to documentation
7. No programmer can succeed without getting used to looking for documentation and samples online 
8. In the code pane declare a variable and assign a numeric value to it
9. Use `if` statement to compare the value of the variable to some other number
10. When the value is greater than the variable's value print out using `console.log` the following text: 'the value is greater than the variable value'
11. Otherwise print 'the value is not greater than the variable value', you will need to learn how to use [else](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/javascript-tutorial/javascript-if-else-statements.php) statement to achieve the desired behaviour
12. Use `run` button to execute your code and resolve issues if any reported
13. Once verified the results, clear the code pane to start over
14. Declare a new variable `let a = 0;`
15. Define a loop using `for` statement to increment the variable `a` until it reaches `10`
16. Print the value of `a` using `console.log` inside loop
17. Print the value of `a` using `console.log` when the loop has finished
18. Once verified the results, clear the `for` loop
19. Re-create the loop with `while` loop to achieve the same results
20. Then re-create the loop with `do...while` loops to the achieve the same result
