# Attributes

[![](/assets/html-attribute.png)](https://clearlydecoded.com/anatomy-of-html-tag)

* In addition to Html tags, we have covered previously, there are also [attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp)
* An attribute modifies the appearance of an Html element type
* Example:`<table border="1px">` where `border` is an attribute with the value `1px` for element `table`
* Border attribute will add a border around the table and between every table cell
* Attribute names do not tolerate spaces, you will find some attributes look like two words together, e.g.: [readonly](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_readonly.asp)
* Attribute values are enclosed in double or single quotes, we will use double quotes for consistency
* [Attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_attributes.asp), similarly to elements, are well known and are getting added and removed over time
* An anchor attribute is used to link a text or an image to another page/website
* Example of a link: `<a href="https://www.google.ca">`A link to Google website`</a>`
