* Html is markup language that uses tags to define elements within a document
* Html is an abbreviation for Hypertext Markup Language
* Markup language is made up of symbols used to indicate how the content should look when it is displayed
* The tags are used to format the content but are not displayed on their own, e.g. `<h1>Headline</h1>`
* Every tag needs to be opened and closed in a nested fashion, e.g.`<html><body>Hello there!</body></html>`

* Html went through its own evolution from version 1 to current version 5 with next versions  coming
* We will be using Html in this course to interact with the code we will be writing
